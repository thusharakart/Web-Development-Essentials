Go to the newly created folder and run the application

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

    > npm start
    Starts the development server.

    > npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

    > npm test
    Starts the test runner.

    > npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

> npm start
